# KoSEnd
We introduce the **Korean Sentence Endings Dataset (KoSEnd)**, which includes 3,000 snetences and 45,000 sentence ending labels. These were collected from diverse source to cover a wide range of contexts. Following Korean grammar rules, we expanded each sentence into 15 variations, including declarative and imperative forms. The naturalness of these sentences was carefully reviewed through a two-stage annotation process.
